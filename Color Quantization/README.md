# Color Quantization and PCA
Machine Learning Color Quantization and PCA for Images

Python 3 was used.

### Libraries used:
* pca from sklearn.decomposition
* cv2 from opencv-python
* Path
* KMeans from sklearn.cluster 
* Numpy
* Skimage 

### **Execution** 
1) Unzip the folder
2) Go to part 3
3) For Color Quantization
```python
    $ python ColorQuantization.py
```
Output files are stored in quantizedImages folder
4) For PCA
```python
    $ python pca.py
```
Output files are stored in compressedImages folder
